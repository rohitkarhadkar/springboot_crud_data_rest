The Spring Data REST project extends the capabilities of the "Employee Directory" project by integrating Spring Data REST for exposing RESTful APIs based on Spring Data repositories. With Spring Data REST, developers can effortlessly expose domain models as REST resources, enabling clients to interact with the application using standard HTTP methods. This project exemplifies the use of modern RESTful practices for building scalable and interoperable web services.
